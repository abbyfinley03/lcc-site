<li><strong></strong><h1>   how to deal with boredom during quarantine </h1><h1></h1></li>
<li><strong></strong><p>  Anyone else bored during quarantine? Well if you are i have some things to make quarantine 10x<sup>(2)</sup> times better. First, you can have family game nights, just pick your favorite game and have fun. Secondly, you can look at suggested movies and TV shows and binge watch your favorites. My favorites that i highly suggest are<b><i> The 100, Grey’s Anatomy, and All American</i></b> <!-- literally binge watched the whole quarantine--> if none of this works keep reading because i have more things to keep you busy during quarantine.</p></li>

<li><strong></strong><h3>   thoughts that made quarantine easier for me</h3></li>
<li>
<p> I know being stuck in the house can be hard but think about it like this... this is just extra quality time to spend with your loved ones. We really take things for granted like being able to go outside, eating food, or even drinking H<sub>2</sub>O. And i feel like this just teaches us to be grateful for what we have so...
</p></li>
<li>
</li><li> take showers, play games, draw, and just enjoy this time we've been given.</li> because like Epictetus said <blockquote> make the best use of what is in your power, and take the rest as it happens.</blockquote> <!--don't forget to just have fun we'll be ok. -->
